# Why My Friends and I Structure Life in Seasons

After graduating college, it's easy to sleepwalk through life. Here's my favorite antidote.

In school, we had semesters. In sports they called them seasons — 3-month chunks of time with a clear beginning, middle, and end.

For the first 22 years, life created this structure *for you*. But after graduation, you lose it. And you're left staring into an endless abyss of unstructured time.

So my friends and I implemented seasons of our own.

## Why Seasons Work

**1. They create a North Star to aim at.**

When you define what you're optimizing for over the next 3 months, every daily decision gets easier. "Does this move me closer to my May 1st vision?" becomes the filter.

**2. They let you romanticize the story as you get closer.**

There's something powerful about being able to say "I'm in week 8 of 15." You start to see the narrative arc of your own life. You can feel the momentum building.

**3. They're short enough to feel the day-to-day reward, but long enough to complete something real.**

A year is too long — you lose urgency. A month is too short — you can't ship anything meaningful. Three months is the sweet spot.

## How We Run Seasons

Each season has a few simple components:

- **A start date and end date** (usually ~15 weeks)
- **A focus area** for each member
- **Weekly check-ins** to track progress against goals
- **A group of 4-6 people** who hold each other accountable

The people matter more than the framework. You want friends who are building something, who will actually show up, and who won't let you coast.

## What I've Learned Running Seasons

The biggest insight: **most people don't fail because they lack talent or resources. They fail because they lack structure.**

When you have a group of friends all pushing toward their own goals within the same timeframe, you get this compounding effect. Their energy feeds yours. Their wins remind you what's possible.

And when you stumble — because you will — you have people who know exactly where you were trying to go and can help you course-correct.

## Try It Yourself

Here's the challenge: text 3-5 friends who are working on something. Set a start date. Define your individual North Stars. Check in weekly.

It doesn't need to be complicated. The structure itself is the unlock.

Send me your vision and I'll drop a voice memo to hold you to it.
