# 2025: The Year I Actually Did the Thing

2025 was the year I actually "did the thing."

Not talked about doing the thing. Not planned to do the thing next year. Actually did it.

## What Happened

- Took a gap from UIUC
- Moved to San Francisco
- Became an Engineer at [Origami](https://origami.chat) (YC F24)
- Made content for Jesse Itzler with SEI
- Posted 33 reels on Instagram
- Hosted 6 hangouts for entrepreneurial friends
- Flew back and forth to officially graduate with a degree in Finance from Gies College of Business at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign

Looking at that list now, it doesn't even feel real. At the start of 2025, I had a few hundred dollars to my name, working out of 1871 in Chicago. I'd made a whole slideshow about what 9 months could look like. Presented it to my mom.

And then I actually went and did it.

## Lesson 1: Most People Are One Macro-Action Away from Changing Their Life

A macro-action is one decision that makes SO MANY downstream decisions easier that it's essentially a no-brainer.

For me, it was moving to San Francisco.

That single move meant: ambitious people everywhere, better career opportunities, higher standards for what "normal" looks like. All downstream of one choice.

At the end of 2024, I was complacent in Champaign. I was the ceiling of my environment — the top of the pond. Moving to SF flipped that. I went from ceiling to floor. And that shift *forced* me to grow in ways that staying never could have.

**If you want to change yourself, the easiest way is to change your environment.** Move to a new city. Join a new community. Put yourself at the bottom of a better pond.

## Lesson 2: Say "Yes" Until Your Time Becomes Valuable, Then Say "No" to Keep It That Way

Classic supply and demand. But here's what made it hard:

The same things I had previously been *rewarded* for saying "yes" to — building $700 websites, going on every coffee chat, posting on TikTok — were the things now required to cut.

It goes like this:

1. You start with a surplus of time
2. You use it to become more valuable
3. More people want access to you
4. Suddenly there's a shortage
5. You can't give it away like you used to

**The first stage challenges your ability to learn new skills. The fifth challenges your ability to ruthlessly prioritize.**

Going into 2025, I was in stage 1. By the end, I was firmly in stage 5. And the transition was one of the hardest things I've ever navigated.

## The Unsexy Truth

Some things I did well: going deep on engineering for six months even when it didn't have immediate payoff. Walking that graduation stage for my parents. Building real relationships in a new city.

Some things I didn't: financial planning, maintaining my health, responding to texts from people who matter.

Success is measured over a lifetime, not one year. Some of the bets I made in 2025 won't pay off for years. And that's okay.

## Looking Ahead

Although I understand there are indeed levels to this game, I'm proud nonetheless — 2025 will always have a special place in my heart.

Now onto 2026.
