# Why I Started Hosting Dinners Again

There's this moment I love.

When I see two close friends I've introduced pull their chairs closer and ask, "So how do you know Austin?"

## The Backstory

Back at UIUC, I hosted casual rooftop hangouts, co-working spaces, and even a pitch competition with My First Million. My sophomore year, I'd started an interview channel — "School of Hard Knocks" style talks with student founders and creators.

After dozens of interviews, I realized: these people had no idea who each other were. So I started hosting hangouts for entrepreneurs — content creators, agency owners, startup founders — anyone working on something cool.

Nothing crazy. I'd get a friend's apartment key, tell everyone to meet there, buy some drinks, and tell people to pull up.

Over time I would see them make viral videos together, start working together, and even become close friends. That was probably the highlight of my year.

## Then I Went Dark

For my first 3 months in SF, I said "no" to everything besides Origami, the gym, and side projects.

It was necessary. When you move to a new city to join a startup, you need to earn your seat at the table before you start hosting tables of your own. The heads-down period mattered.

But something was missing.

## Coming Back to the Table

Now that I've started hosting dinners again, I've realized something:

Yes, I love Cursor, a Ghost Energy Drink, and the Social Network soundtrack until 3am.

But I also love manually sending 10 texts to get the right people around a table.

## What I've Learned About Hosting

1. **The guest list is everything.** 6-8 people is the sweet spot. Enough diversity of perspective, small enough that everyone talks to everyone.

2. **Don't overthink the venue.** Some of the best conversations I've had were at the cheapest spots. People come for the people, not the food.

3. **Be the bridge.** The best thing you can do as a host is introduce two people who should know each other and then get out of the way.

4. **Do it consistently.** One dinner is an event. Monthly dinners are a community. The compounding happens when people start coming back.

## Work-Life Balance Is Real (Unfortunately)

Techbro discovers work-life balance. Crazy, right?

But for the first time, I feel like I'm experiencing both without sacrificing the other. The engineering work is better because I'm not burned out. The dinners are better because I actually have something to talk about.

Let me know of any SF gems I haven't found yet. Always another seat at the table.
